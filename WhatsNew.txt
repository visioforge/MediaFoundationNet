Added a series of extensions to Media Foundation interfaces
and externs.  See readme.mfext.html for more information.

At this point, all testable interfaces have been tested.  No
further work is planned for MediaFoundation.dll.

Be aware that .Net Framework v4.0.3 requires KB2495593.

Also in v3.0, the licensing has been expanded to support BSD.

New samples have been added showing how to write Media 
Foundation Transforms (MFTs), along with templates to make 
them easier to write.

Moved to framework v4.0.3.

Also, it is now possible to get MSDN help for MFNet interfaces inside Visual 
Studio. Run docs\insthelp.cmd to configure this features for VS2012, 2013 & 
2015.

The error handling has been significantly re-worked.  In earlier versions, methods 
that failed would automatically throw exceptions.  This version returns the COM 
result codes as integers.  If you have code written to previous versions of this 
library, you'll need to modify your code for every call to the MF library, like 
this:

   int hr;

   hr = iSomething.DoSomething();
   MFError.ThrowExceptionForHR(hr); // Turn hr into exception if it was an error

This was changed because:

1) Consistent with the MF docs
2) Significantly better performance when exceptions are thrown
3) Consistent with other libraries (DS & WM)
4) Some methods already had to use the integer return method,
resulting in internal inconsistencies and coder confusion.

Also, given the newness of MF and the free availability of 2010 Express
the solution files for VS2008 and VS2005 have been removed.

The new lib is compiled with VS 2008 (framework v3.5).  However, this should still
work properly with apps from VS2005.

There were a few minor perf changes.  I also changed the def for BitmapInfoHeader
to be consistent with DirectShow.  Yes, it will cause problems for (a few) MFLib
users.  However, it makes life less confusing when you use both libraries.

Also, I added new interfaces to the alt.cs file.  Check out the comments at
the top of the file for details.

Since the last release, I have gotten the EVRPresenter sample to work.  This
was a HUGE and finicky project.  It required adding support for a number of 
MF interfaces.

So, in order to have a release of MFNet that would work with this new 
sample, I decided it was time to do a v1.1.  Since I was doing another 
release I decided to also attack all the remaining Vista interfaces. 
I picked the last of the easy interfaces, and all of the remaining 
ones I find to be interesting.  

At this point, I don't plan to do any more of the vista interfaces 
unless there are specific requests.  If you request an interface, be 
prepared to help test it!

There have been *significant* changes since beta 2.  Commenting,
more enums, and some serious re-working of the PropVariant class,
which affects a number of methods.

In addition to testing a bunch more interfaces and externs, I have 
finished translating 7 of the 8 samples that ship with the the PSDK, 
plus 1 sample that only exists in the mf sdk docs.  Note: The samples 
are in a separate download.  Make sure you grab it too!

-----------------------------------------------------------------
v.091 beta 2

A few more tested externs (for the GrayScale sample)
Two more tested interfaces: IMFTransform, IMF2DBuffer
Fix DllImport statement for PropVariantClear (Thanks Stephen!)
Helper class MFInt

General cleanup of some of the methods in the untested area
Fix the name for GetGUID to match MF docs
Change SafeRelease to a much simpler function
Remove ParseError in favor of Marshal.GetHRForException()
Remove ISequentialStream & IStream in favor of .Net's implementation
